Centralized exchanges have issues:
- user does not control private key
- they could run away with their money
- hacks (eg. Mt. Gox, Bitfinex)
- opaque operation
- potential favoritism
- user have to submit identity information, resulting in privacy concern and leak of private info

Crypto space people have dreamed and desired decentralized exchange.  However, current offerings of decentralized exchange often suffer from high-fee and high latency.  

Compared to other decentralized exchanges, our decentralized exchange built on top of EOS will have
- low latency
- lower fee
- 0-fee to modify unexecuted orders (This is significant.  Think about how many times you cacnel the unexecuted orders or modify the price because market changes.  Current offering of decentralized exchange tends to require fee to modify orders)
- more flexible. Allow fungible token and non-fungible token trading.  Allow derivatives trading.  Allow contract-to-contract trading.

Compared to centralized exchanges, our decentralized exchanges will have
- no custodial needed.  We could not run away with your money.
- transparent operation

Decentralized exchange is an important part of EOS ecosystem.  It will help bolster usage of EOS network.  Blockchain is an internet of value, we need to be able to allow user to exchange values freely.
